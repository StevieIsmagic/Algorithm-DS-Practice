/* for N elements in the array, how many steps would our Alg take in a worst case scenario?

we conclude that for N elements in the array, our function would perform N^2 comparisions,
since we perform an outer loop that must iterate N times to get through the entire array,
and for each iteration, we must iterate another N times with our inner loop. That's 
N steps * N steps, which is otherwise known as N^2 steps = O(N^2).

/* 
this implementation uses an array called existingNumbers in an interesting way:
Every time the code encounters a new number, it stores the value 1 inside the index of 
the existingNumbers corresponding to that number. If it checks an index, and it finds
the number 1, it means we a;ready encountered that number before.

Example: if given the array [3,5,7], by the end of the loop, existingNumbers
array will look like this > [undef, undef, 1, undef, 1, undef, 1]
