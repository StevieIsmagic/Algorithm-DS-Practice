Stacks (LIFO) and Queues (FIFO) are simply arrays with restrictions.
They are useful for handling temporary data, from 
operating system architecture, to printing jobs,
to traversing data, stacks and queues serve as temporary 
containers that can be used to form beautiful algorithms

STACK CONSTRAINTS:
- Data can only be Inserted at the end of stack
- Data can only be Read from the end of stack
- Data can only be Removed from the end of stack
