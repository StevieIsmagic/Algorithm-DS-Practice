# Quick Sort Fun Facts

C library function qsort() is a quick sort variant called quicker sort

Belongs to Divide and Conquer Family - Multi-branched Recursion
(e.g., Mergesort, Binary Search, MapReduce, etc.)

Break the problem into subproblems that are similar to the original problem. Three(3) Steps:

* Divide
* Conquer
* Combine

# Big O

* Best Case Time Complexity- O(N log N)
* Average Case Time Complexity- O(N log N)
* Worse Case Time Complexity- O(N^2)

#### What would cause a worst case O(N^2) scenario... ?

* An inversely sorted array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# Recursive Solution

Base Case: ?
